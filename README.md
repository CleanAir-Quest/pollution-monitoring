# CleanAir Quest - Optimal Pollution Monitoring Location 

## Overview
CleanAir Quest is a data-driven project aiming to optimize pollution monitoring by identifying optimal locations for pollution monitoring stations. The project uses machine learning models and environmental data to determine the best sites for monitoring air quality.

## Objectives
- Analyze air pollution data from various locations.
- Identify correlations between Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant concentrations, geographic location & time.
- Develop a machine learning model to suggest optimal pollution monitoring station locations.
- Deploy the model.

## Project Outline and Technologies
1. **Data Collection:** Utilized OpenWeatherMap's Airpollution API to query air pollution and geographical data through Postman API.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, processed, and engineered features for analysis on Azure ML Studio notebooks.
3. **Model Development:** Trained and tested the model to predict the Air Quality Index on Azure ML Studio.
4. **Deployment:** Deployed the model using Azure Machine Learning Service.

## Business Aspect
- There are limited resources for pollution monitoring in Africa, bringing about the needed for informed decision making to ensure optimal resource allocation.
- By accurately predicting the AQI, governments and organizations can put up pollution monitoring stations in the most vulnerable locations.
- This could include locations with consistently low AQIs, recurring/seasonal variations or high variance in AQI levels.
- We can save organizations a lot of costs and time by providing this affordable and convenient service.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature.
- Make your changes.
- Create a pull request for review.
- 
## Target Market
 - Governments and non-governmental organizations in the environmental tracking space.

## Disadvantages
 - Our solution still relies on a number of inputs that may not be readily available for some users. We hope to resolve this in later iterations by reducing the number of features needed while still maintaining model accuracy.

## Why us? 
- Agricultural production, health outcomes, climate change management and more are heavily dependent on environmental tracking and more specifically, air pollution monitoring. Our solution provides an easy and convenient solution for providing air quality metrics necessary for this.

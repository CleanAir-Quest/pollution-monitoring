# Optimal Pollution Monitoring Location - CleanAir Quest Project

## Overview
CleanAir Quest is a data-driven project aiming to optimize pollution monitoring by identifying optimal locations for pollution monitoring stations. The project uses machine learning models and environmental data to determine the best sites for monitoring air quality.

## Objectives
- Analyze air pollution data from various locations.
- Identify correlations between pollutant concentrations and geographical features.
- Develop a machine learning model to suggest optimal pollution monitoring station locations.
- Deploy the model and provide a user interface for accessibility.

## Project Outline
1. **Data Collection:** Utilize OpenWeatherMap's Airpollution API and geographical data through Postman API.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, process, and engineer features for analysis on Azure ML Studio.
3. **Model Development:** Train and test the model for optimal location suggestions on Azure ML Studio.
4. **Deployment:** Deploy the model using Azure Machine Learning Service.
5. **Application Development:** Develop a web-based interface for user interaction.
